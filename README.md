# RetroComp
RetroComp is a library of fun and simple game to pass the time. Most are made using python and pygame or arcade but other languages can also be used. This library was made for personal python learning, you can see the *Acknowledgements* section for links that helped me make each game.

## Writing & Licensing
The RetroComp library is written by British secondary schoolers in our spare time (Alike our other project: [*`MonumentalMountain`*](https://github.com/JTech-Labs/MonumentalMountain)) so please be respectful if updates take some time to be released. The Python files are compiled into executables with nuitka using the respective OS. All the code is licensed under GNU GPL v3.0.
